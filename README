This is an utility for transposing an audio file, by specifying the desired interval in semitones. 

Note that this does **not** preserve note durations, as it is intended as a simple utility for MIR tasks (in particular, the alignment of two recordings of the same piece with different key signatures).

Compile with:
g++ -o transposer -O3 -lsndfile -lsamplerate transposer.cpp

Uses libsndfile (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/) and libsamplerate (http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/index.html).

Code is released under GPL.
